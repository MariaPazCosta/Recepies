    <h1>Cinnamon Rolls</h1>
    <h3>Little bit of history</h3>
        <p>Cinnamon rolls, also known as cinnamon buns, have a rich and delicious history that spans centuries and continents. The origin of cinnamon rolls is often traced back to Northern Europe, particularly Sweden, where they are called "kanelbullar." In Sweden, cinnamon rolls have been a beloved pastry since at least the 18th century.</p>
        <p>The Swedish tradition of fika, a coffee break accompanied by pastries, helped popularize cinnamon rolls. Kanelbullar are typically less sweet and contain cardamom in addition to cinnamon, which distinguishes them from their American counterparts.</p>
        <p>Cinnamon rolls made their way to North America through European immigrants. In the United States, they evolved into a sweeter and often larger treat, sometimes topped with icing or glaze. They became particularly popular in the Midwest and the South. The introduction of pre-made dough and the rise of convenience baking in the 20th century further cemented their place in American breakfast and dessert culture.</p>
        <p>Today, cinnamon rolls are enjoyed worldwide, with variations and local twists reflecting the diverse cultures that have embraced this delicious pastry.</p>

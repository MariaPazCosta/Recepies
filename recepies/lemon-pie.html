    <h1>Lemon Pie</h1>
    <h3>Little bit of history</h3>
    <p>Lemon pie, particularly the classic lemon meringue pie, has a storied history that highlights its evolution through various culinary traditions.</p>
    <p>The origins of lemon pie can be traced back to medieval Europe, where lemon custards and curds were popular due to their refreshing flavor and the availability of lemons in the Mediterranean. The lemon pie as we know it began to take shape in the 19th century.</p>
    <p>The first lemon meringue pie recipes appeared in the early 19th century. The combination of tart lemon custard with sweet, fluffy meringue was a natural progression of earlier lemon desserts. The pie became particularly popular in America, where it was embraced for its light, refreshing taste and elegant appearance.</p>
    <p>One of the earliest recorded recipes for lemon meringue pie appeared in an 1869 cookbook by Mrs. Elizabeth Goodfellow, a well-known Philadelphia pastry chef and teacher. Her version of the pie set the standard for what would become a beloved American dessert.</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <h3>For the Pie Crust:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt.            </li>
            <li><strong>Cut in butter:</strong> Add the chilled butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Add water:</strong> Gradually add the ice water, mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong> Roll out dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Transfer the dough to the pan, trim the edges, and crimp as desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Blind bake: </strong> the crust with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the weights and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, until lightly golden. Let cool.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the Lemon Filling:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients: </strong>  In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Add water: </strong> Gradually stir in the water, cooking over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.</li>
            <li><strong>Temper egg yolks:</strong>Remove from heat. Slowly whisk about 1/2 cup of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks to temper them, then return the egg mixture to the saucepan </li>
            <li><strong>Cook filling:</strong> Bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Pour the filling into the baked pie crust.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the Lemon Meringue:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat egg whites: In a large, clean bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
            </li>
            <li>Add sugar: Gradually add the sugar, beating until stiff, glossy peaks form.
            </li>
            <li>Top the pie: Spread the meringue over the hot lemon filling, sealing the edges to prevent shrinking.</li>
        </ol>

    <h1>PANCAKES</h1>
    <h3><em>Little bit of history</em></h3>
        <p>Pancakes have an ancient and diverse history, tracing back thousands of years to early human civilizations. Evidence of early pancakes, made from ground grains and water cooked on hot stones, dates back to the Stone Age. Notably, Otzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy, had remnants of primitive pancakes in his stomach. Ancient Greeks and Romans had their versions: "tagenites" and "alita dolcia," respectively. 
        </p>
        <p>During the Middle Ages, pancakes were a staple in Europe, often made with wheat flour, eggs, milk, and sometimes wine or ale. 
            They were particularly popular during Lent to use up perishable ingredients. 
            By the Renaissance, regional variations like French crêpes and Russian blini emerged.</p>
        <p>Pancakes were brought to America by European settlers, evolving with local ingredients such as cornmeal and buckwheat, and sweetened with maple syrup. The Industrial Revolution made flour more accessible, leading to the widespread popularity of pancakes, and the introduction of ready-made mixes in the 20th century further cemented their status as a breakfast favorite. Today, pancakes are enjoyed globally in myriad forms, from thin French crêpes to thick American-style pancakes, with diverse toppings reflecting their universal appeal.</p>
